## Building
- `npm install`
- `npm pack` to build once

## Ideas for further development

### Performance

- test BufferGeometry
- use https://threejs.org/docs/#Reference/Objects/LineSegments 
for single color mode

### Functionality

- 3D interpretation of the problem
- Josephus Problem
- Arbitrary shapes (Square, Triangle, ...)
